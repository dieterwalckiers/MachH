The idea is to implement mollie in following way:

When an event is marked as "subscriptionIsPaid" and there's a price defined, the user will be redirected to Mollie after filling in the event's subscription form.
This will be implemented using the package "@mollie/api-client".
Here's an example of how it's implemented in another project:

```
const payment = await this.mollieClient.payments.create({
    amount: {
        currency: 'EUR',
        value: amount.toFixed(2)
    },
    description,
    redirectUrl,
    metadata: {
        itemId,
        firstName,
        lastName,
        email
    },
    webhookUrl: process.env.MOLLIE_WEBHOOK_URL!,
});
```

where webhookUrl is an url to our app, that Mollie accesses when it's processed the payment.
When this call (from mollie) comes in, we check the status of the payment using `mollieClient.payments.get(paymentId)`
and if succesful, the actualy reservation is done (like it is right now)
